## Benefits

### 1. Improve Nutritional Intake

Estimated [10 - 20% of Australians meet fruit and vegetable recommendation](https://www.abs.gov.au/statistics/health/health-conditions-and-risks/dietary-behaviour/2020-21), most averaging half the recommended servings. Is this you?

### 2. Save On Grocery Expenditure

Meal prepping for $1.8 per meal equates to $2000/year/person compared to the average of $5000/year/person on groceries.
Perhaps this could be attributed to the high cost of eating out, ranging from $10 - $20 per meal.

### 3. Positive Environmental Impact

Meal planning reduces food waste. Over 2.5 million tonnes of food is wasted by Australian households. These foods are dumped in landfills that release methane, which warms the planet 25x more than CO2. Additionally, healthier foods are usually more friendly for the environment.

### 4. Decrease Food Prep Time

Optimise for bulk buying and meal prepping. Healthy food should be convenient.
