## Benefits

### Improve Nutritional Intake
Estimated [10 - 20% of Australians meet fruit and vegetable recommendation](https://www.abs.gov.au/statistics/health/health-conditions-and-risks/dietary-behaviour/2020-21), most averaging half the recommended servings. Is this you?

### Reduce Grocery Expenditure
Meal prepping for $1.8 per meal equates to $2000/year/person compared to the average of $5000/year/person on groceries.
Perhaps this could be attributed to the high cost of eating out, ranging from $10 - $20 per meal.

### Decrease food prep time
Optimise for bulk buying and meal prepping. Healthy food should be convenient.
